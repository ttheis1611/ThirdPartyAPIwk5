# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## UTA WK5 - ThirdPartyAPIwk5
Week 5 challenge for UTA bootcamp.

## GOAL
Create a work day planner with normal work hours. This project will include text for each hour and save buttons. This schedule has an added CLEAR tasks button.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

    2. Stephany Comacho - Who had a terrific page with a fix for time AM/PM (I just had to have it)

    3. Shirley Rivera - Had a great working planner and was the inspiration for the iterative sections
